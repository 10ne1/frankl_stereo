       frankl's stereo utilities
       =========================

This is a collection of programs and scripts to be used for stereo
playback via a computer.

These programs are free software, see files 'License.txt' and 'COPYING'
for details. Note in particular that using them is on your own risk.

Run a program with option '--help' to read its documentation.

Overview:

 - volrace
      implements a simple form of the RACE algorithm and can be used
      for volume control

 - netplay
      reads an audio stream from the network (or stdin) and sends it 
      to a sound device

 - bufhrt
      reads data from stdin, a file, or the network and writes them
      to stdout, a network port or a file

 - writeloop/catloop
      reads data from stdin and writes it cyclically to some files,
      and vice versa   (to buffer data in a ramdisk)

 - listenloop/send_to_netplay
      example scripts which demonstrate the use of netplay/bufhrt

The main idea of 'netplay' and 'bufhrt' is that data are written in
very regular intervals using the highres timer functionality
of the Linux kernel.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
