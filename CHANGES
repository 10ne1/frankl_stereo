        Changes between published versions

0.6 to 0.7

Comments for users of previous versions: Four main ideas went into this
release, each of these cause audible improvements in my setup:

(1) Use of the mmap interface in ALSA with playhrt. This reduces the
    copying of audio data and makes the patch of the ALSA library which
    was proposed in previous versions unnecessary. It may be necessary to
    use a slightly larger hardware buffer than before for the audio
    device (--hw-buffer option).

(2) Optional use of shared memory in various places. Shared memory can be used
    to transfer data between different programs. Compared to a transfer via
    files this avoids file system overhead, and compared to transfer via pipes
    this avoids (difficult to control and understand) buffer management by
    the operating system.

(3) Cleaning RAM before writing, and refreshing data in RAM. The content of
    RAM also gets refreshed on hardware level. With explicit reading and
    rewriting of data in RAM (which look superfluous on the programming
    level) we try to represent data "cleaner" in RAM before they are sent
    to the next program or to the next computer or to the sound device.
    This leads to surprising audible improvements in my setup. Several
    variants were tested over longer periods, for ARM computers we
    provide assembler code.

(4) From experiments I found that the physical representation of music
    files on a hard disk influences the sound quality during playback,
    even if the data are heavily processed before playback. This release
    contains a script 'improvefile' which uses bufhrt to produce a
    bit identical copy of a file on a hard disk. I have tried this for many
    music files on my hard disk and made an audible comparison of the two
    files, the copied file always sounded "better" and in some cases it
    revealed remarkably more details of the music. I have not made
    experiments with SSDs.

And here is a more detailed list of CHANGES.

- new scripts: 'improvefile' for bit identical but different sounding
  files on hard disks; 'playflac441' as an example script for playback of
  a flac file in 44.1/16 format

- new utility functions used by cptoshm, shmcat, bufhrt and playhrt:
  refreshmem and memclean are used to rewrite data in RAM, respectively
  to clean RAM before overwriting, assembler versions are provided for
  ARM and ARM-vfp architectures

- bufhrt: added --shared input option, can be used directly with writeloop
  and without a pipe from catloop (so that the operating system has fewer
  buffers to maintain)

- all programs: numerous improvements in the documentation and in the
  information printed with --verbose flags (many of these suggested by
  Simon Rambert)

- playhrt: new option --mmap which uses the low level mmap driver interface
  of ALSA drivers (in contrast to aplay). This mode is now recommended, even
  over the version with a patched ALSA library, as was suggested in
  version 0.6.

- playhrt: new option --number-channels for use with multi-channel setups
  (requested and tested by Simon Rambert)

- writeloop: allow input from file via --from-file option

- writeloop and catloop: introduce --shared option for using shared memory
  instead of files

- new utilities cptoshm and shmcat: copy data to a shared memory region in
  RAM, respectively write these data to stdout

- bufhrt: introduced --interval mode, repeatedly buffers data without
  output and then outputs chunks with precise timing and no reading

0.5 to 0.6

- playhrt: now writes data directly after sleep, before loop that checks
  the result

- volrace did not work with 32-bit input, is fixed now (reported by
  lililinux)
